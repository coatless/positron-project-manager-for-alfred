# Positron - Project Manager for Alfred

Simple integration of [Project Manager (OpenVSX)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/alefragnani/project-manager) with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

It supports both static and Git projects created using Project Manager in Positron. Use the keyword `tron` to pull up a list of projects.
